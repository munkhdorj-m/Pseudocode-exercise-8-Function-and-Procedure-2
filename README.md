# Pseudocode Exercise 8 Function and Procedure

---

## Exercise 1

Write a procedure to output how many odd and even digit given number have.

    Example:
    Input: "12345"
    Output: "Odd digit: 3, Even digit: 2"

## Exercise 2

Write pseudocode for the function CountVowels(). A function CountVowels() will count and return the number of occurrences of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string <br />
The string may contain both upper and lower case characters.

    Example: 
    Input: "Oliver Hebert"
    Output: 5
        
    Input: "Roast goose"
    Output: 4
    
## Exercise 3

A program uses two 1D arrays of type integer. Array1 contains 30 elements and Array2 contains 10 elements.<br/><br/>
Array1 contains sample values read from a sensor. The sensor always takes three consecutive samples and all of these values are stored in Array1.<br/><br/>
A procedure Summarise() will calculate the average of three consecutive values from Array1 and write the result to Array2. This will be repeated for all values in Array1. <br/><br/>
The diagram below illustrates the process for the first six entries in Array1.<br/><br/>
