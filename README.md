# Pseudocode Exercise 8 Function and Procedure

---

## Exercise 1

Write a procedure to output how many odd and event digit given number have.

    Example:
    Input: "12345"
    Output: "Odd digit: 3, Even digit: 2"

## Exercise 2

Write pseudocode for the procedure CountVowels(). A procedure CountVowels() will: <br /><br/>
  • be called with a string containing alphanumeric characters as its parameter <br />
  • count and output the number of occurrences of each vowel (a, e, i, o, u) in the string <br />
  • count and output the number of occurrences of the other alphabetic characters (as a single total). <br /><br/>
The string may contain both upper and lower case characters.
Each count value will be stored in a unique element of a global 1D array CharCount of type
INTEGER. The array will contain six elements.


    
## Exercise 3

A program uses two 1D arrays of type integer. Array1 contains 600 elements and Array2 contains 200 elements.<br/><br/>
Array1 contains sample values read from a sensor. The sensor always takes three consecutive samples and all of these values are stored in Array1.<br/><br/>
A procedure Summarise() will calculate the average of three consecutive values from Array1 and write the result to Array2. This will be repeated for all values in Array1. <br/><br/>
The diagram below illustrates the process for the first six entries in Array1.<br/><br/>
